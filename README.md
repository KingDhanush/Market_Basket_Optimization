Market Basket Analysis What is it? Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more likely to buy another group of items. For example, if you are in an English pub and you buy a pint of beer and don't buy a bar meal, you are more likely to buy crisps  at the same time than somebody who didn't buy beer.

The set of items a customer buys is referred to as an itemset, and market basket analysis seeks to find relationships between purchases.
